## The Slate-Mod theme
----------------------

This is a sample website to illustrate how the Slate-Mod theme displays Markdown.

<br>


### 1. Standard text
--------------------

Text in **bold**, *italic* and ~~strikethrough~~ looks like this.

<br>


### 2. Links and Images
-----------------------

Here is an inline image referenced from [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/125745-lolcats) and included using the Markdown image syntax.

<br>


### 3. Lists
------------

Ordered list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 3

Unordered list:

* Item 1
* Item 2

Nested ordered > unordered list:

1. Item 1
   * Item 1a
   * Item 1b

2. Item 2
   * Item 2.1

<br>


### 4. Tables
-------------

Example table:

| Header 1    | Header 2    | Header 3    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Row 1/Col 1 | Row 1/Col 2 | Row 1/Col 3 |
| Row 2/Col 1 | Row 2/Col 2 | Row 2/Col 3 |

<br>


### 5. Blockquotes
------------------

This quote from Newton provides a nice summary of the role of Occam's Razor in modern science:

<br>

> We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.
> Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.

<br>

Alternatively, Bertrand Russel summarises the principle more succinctly as:

<br>

> Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities.

<br>

### 6. Code
-----------

`Python` code with syntax highlighting looks like this:

```python
# Spam.py

for i in range(1, 5):
    print(", ".join(i * ["Spam"]) + ", Eggs and Spam")
```
